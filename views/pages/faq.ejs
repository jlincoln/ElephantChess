      <h1>Elephant Chess Rules</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>The elephant piece can NEVER be captured nor can it capture any chess piece.</li>
        <li>The elephant piece is obtained by a player who captures an opponent's piece.</li>
        <li>The elephant piece can be placed on ANY empty square.</li>
        <li>The square the elephant piece currently resides becomes IMPASSABLE to both players.</li>
      </ol>
      <h1>Domination or Catch and Release Game Modes</h1>
      <p><strong>Domination</strong>: A player who currently dominates (controls) the elephant piece can choose to move it or a regular chess piece when it's their turn but cannot move the elephant and a regular chess piece simultaneously(at the same time).  The exception to this rule only applies to the first player when capturing the first chess piece.</p>
      <p><strong>Catch and Release</strong>: A player who captures an opponent's piece can move the elephant simultaneously (during the same turn) upon capturing their opponent's chess piece.</p>
      <p><strong>Addendum</strong>: The elephant piece is used to hinder/disrupt an opponent's strategies during the course of the game. It can be used offensively as well as defensively.</p>
